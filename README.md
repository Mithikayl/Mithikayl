# Hello!
hiya. you're looking at my github page (for some reason)! 
my name's mithikayl (or mith) and i enjoy programming.
i have [my own website](https://mithikayl.tk) which is [open source](https://github.com/Mithikayl/redoingsite).
i enjoy doing html, css and some programming in python and javascript.
right now my bucket list in regards to coding is to:
- learn javascript effectively
- learn java itself and hopefully c#
- create a webapp
- make my own open source software
- learn how to do deep data analysis within python

i'll tick stuff off as i go along, i suppose.

if you wanna reach me, i'm a few clicks away at my [email](mailto:mithikaylbusiness@gmail.com).

if i'm working on any projects, i'll add em.

have a good day :D
